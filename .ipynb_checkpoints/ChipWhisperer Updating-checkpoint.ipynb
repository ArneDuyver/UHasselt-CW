You can also clear the output of a cell or multiple cells via the menu above: `Cell -> Current Outputs/All Outputs -> Clear`. **!Note that clearing the outputs does not clear any stored variables etc. from running code blocks.** To completely restart the notebook and clear all variables etc. you need to press the `restart the kernel (with dialog)`-button in the ribbon.
