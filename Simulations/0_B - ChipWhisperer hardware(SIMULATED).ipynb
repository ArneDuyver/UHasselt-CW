Plugged in, the device looks like the image below. The pcb consists of two parts: the chipwhisperer board and the target board. The target board is wired up to the CW-board through the pcb. (If you would want to do so, you can seperate the boards via the perforated line. That way you can connect the chipwhisperer to your own target).\n",

In the following tutorials we will primarily use the chipwhisperer to measure the power consumption of the target while it is performing some kind of encryption.\n",
