    "# Countermeasure to SPA on RSA(SIMULATED)\n",
    "In the previous notebook series you learned how to crack different types of encryption algorithms. Now it's time to think about how to implement the algorithms in a way that prevents people for using those attacks succesfully.\n",
    "In this notebook you will learn how to take a simple countermeasure against a simple power analysis attack on the RSA encryption system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    "* Learn how to \"invent\" a countermeasure against a SPA against RSA.\n",
    "* Implement that countermeasure in the source code. \n",
    "* Try a SPA on our newly implemented SPA and watch it fail.\n",

    "## Coming up with a simple countermeasure\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's shortly cover how and why an SPA works. The SPA takes advantage of the fact that in order for the target to perform an exponential operation it goes through a for-loop. When the bit of the exponent is a `1` an extra instruction will be performed by the microcontroller. Lookiing at the power consumtion of the target we can find out when a pass through the for-loop starts. By measuring the time between each pass we can seperate the passes into two groups: passes through the for-loop that are short and passes that take longer. If a pass through the for-loop was long then the bit provided by the exponential number was a `1`. Similarly a short pass corresponds to a `0` bit. The exponent that is used is the secret key of the endcryption/decryption algorithm. By analysing the powerconsumption we could directly recover the secret key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to try and figure out how we can implement a countermeasure. First of all let's define the place of weakness in the implementation: the different length of each pass through the for-loop. So our objective will be to make each pass through the for-loop the same length regardles of the bitvalue of the exponent. As we have seen in notebook `1_B - Attack on RSA` there is an `if-statement` inside the for-loop that runs extra code:\n",
    "```C\n",
    "if(t & (1<<(8-1))){\n",
    "    bigint_mul_u(&res, &res, &base);\n",
    "    bigint_reduce(&res, r);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now there is quiet a simple solution to making the passes the same length. I'll let you think about it for a couple seconds...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe we can just add an `else` to the `if-statement` so that regardless of the value of the bit some instructions will be performed. Now we only need to figure out what instruction we should perform there. The most obvious thing would be to do perform the exact same instrustions as in the `if-statement`. Since what we do in the `else` statement has nothing to do with workings of RSA itself we will need to use some dummy data however. We could use some randomly generated values used in the instructions, but to make it resemble the `if` part even more we can use the exact same values. We have to make sure to use copied values because of what we said earlier.\n",
    "And voila, you successfully \"invented\" a countermeasure to SPA. The next step is to implement the changes in the source code and test our idea."
