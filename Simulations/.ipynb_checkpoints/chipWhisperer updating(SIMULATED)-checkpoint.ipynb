(Since this is one of the first notebooks you shouldn't have any important changes that need to be kept. If you want to update to the newest version when you are already further along in the tutorials. Keep in mind that **all** your changes will be lost, even changes your specifically saved)\n",

You can also explicitly save changes and set a checkpoint for when you might have made changes to code blocks. You can do this by clicking the save icon in the ribbon above or by pressing `ctrl+s`. You can also clear the output of a cell or multiple cells via the menu above: `Cell -> Current Outputs/All Outputs -> Clear`. **!Note that clearing the outputs does not clear any stored variables etc. from running code blocks.** To completely restart the notebook and clear all variables etc. you need to press the `restart the kernel (with dialog)`-button in the ribbon.
