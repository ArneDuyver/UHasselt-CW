    "# Introduction to Jupyter\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are documents that combine Python code, rich text, and additional code (such as Bash), organized into executable blocks. Notebooks allow users to run blocks out of order and multiple times, giving greater control over what's being run than a Python script.\n",

    "## Textblocks\n",

    "\n",
    "## Run basic python code\n",
    "Below is an example of a Python code-block. First select the block by clicking on it. A green or blue border should appear around the block, indicating that the block is selected. Next, hit the `>| Run` button on the toolbar at the top of your screen/or next to the code block to execute the code inside the block. The next block will then be highlighted."
